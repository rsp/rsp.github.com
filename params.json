Doing anything from Commodore BASIC to HTML5, from assembly to Scheme, I was always attracted by languages that were popular and yet misunderstood, with countless examples of code in desperate need for improvement.\r\n\r\nBack in the day, in the ancient era of CGI scripts, Perl was my language of choice, an easy target to find bad code in a good language. Then PHP started to dominate in the bad code market and still is one of the best environments to look for code to fix, but the language itself is not as fun as Perl.\r\n\r\nNowadays I'm working mostly with JavaScript, the world's most popular and yet the most misunderstood programming language, the only language that many people don't think they should learn before using - a mistake that I made myself back in the nineties but luckily I have recovered since then.\r\n\r\nJavaScript while doing its best to look like Java is semantically closer to Scheme. The functional nature of the language together with asynchronous I/O and prototype-based inheritance system makes it extremely expressive and fun to work with.\r\n\r\nI'm always looking forward to fix programs that are broken in new, interesting and creative ways.\r\n\r\nWorking most productively on tight deadlines and fat paychecks.\r\n\r\n### Find me online\r\n\r\n* **[twitter.com/pocztarski](https://twitter.com/pocztarski) (follow me!)**\r\n* **[linkedin.com/in/pocztarski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pocztarski) (connect and endorse my skills!)**\r\n* [plus.google.com/106457556668508404492](https://plus.google.com/106457556668508404492) (not sure what it's for)\r\n* [codepen.io/rsp](http://codepen.io/rsp/) (simple demos of JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3)\r\n* [github.com/rsp](https://github.com/rsp) (some contributions to open-source projects)\r\n* [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/user:rfl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/user:rfl) (administrator since 2004)\r\n* [gittip.com/rsp](https://www.gittip.com/rsp/) (for tips)\r\n* [careers.stackoverflow.com/rsp](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/rsp) (for work)\r\n\r\nProfiles on Stack Exchange:\r\n\r\n* [stackoverflow.com/users/613198](http://stackoverflow.com/users/613198/) (270+ answers, 12k+ reputation)\r\n* [superuser.com/users/160960](http://superuser.com/users/160960/)\r\n* [programmers.stackexchange.com/users/18691](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/18691/)\r\n* [webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/18617](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/18617/)\r\n* [unix.stackexchange.com/users/23774](http://unix.stackexchange.com/users/23774/)\r\n* [askubuntu.com/users/11582](http://askubuntu.com/users/11582/)\r\n* [math.stackexchange.com/users/65499](http://math.stackexchange.com/users/65499/)","google":"UA-35668915-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
